##By using joins, you can retrieve data from two or more tables based on logical relationships between the tables. Joins indicate how SQL Server should use data from one table to select the rows in another table.A join condition defines the way two tables are related in a query by:-Specifying the column from each table to be used for the join. A typical join condition specifies a foreign key from one table and its associated key in the other table.Specifying a logical operator (for example, = or <>,) to be used in comparing values from the columns.Joins are expressed logically using the Transact-SQL syntax:1)INNER JOIN  2)LEFT [ OUTER ] JOIN 3)RIGHT [ OUTER ] JOIN 4)FULL [ OUTER ] JOIN 5)CROSS JOIN *Inner joins can be specified in either the FROM or WHERE clauses. Outer joins and cross joins can be specified in the FROM clause only. The join conditions combine with the WHERE and HAVING search conditions to control the rows that are selected from the base tables referenced in the FROM clause. Specifying the join conditions in the FROM clause helps separate them from any other search conditions that might be specified in a WHERE clause, and is the recommended method for specifying joins.*
And the tool used to run and compail the SQL code is MySQL and online SQL COMPAILER.
